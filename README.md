### Hello there, 
Hello there, I currently am working as a developer at reSolved business solutions. I am also a Computer programming and Analysis Graduate from Seneca College. My preferred stack is MERN (mongoDB, Express, React, Node.js). I mainly work professionally as a Front End Developer but I like to dabble and do some Back End development work whwen I am working on a personal project. I enjoy learning and exploring new technologies.
