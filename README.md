### Hello there, 
I am a Computer programming and Analysis Graduate from Seneca College. My most recent experience was at TDSB as a Junior web Developer where I helped audit and fix web accessibility issues on over 500 web pages. 

I enjoy learning new technologies but my preferred stack is MERN (mongoDB, Express, React, Node.js)
